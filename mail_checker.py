File mode, write and binary. Since you are writing a .jpg file, it looks fine.

But if you supposed to read that jpg file you need to use 'rb'

More info: 

On Windows, 'b' appended to the mode opens the file in binary mode, so there are also modes like 'rb', 'wb', and 'r+b'. 
Python on Windows makes a distinction between text and binary files; the end-of-line characters in text files are 
automatically altered slightly when data is read or written. 
This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for ASCII text files, 
but itâ€™ll corrupt binary data like that in JPEG or EXE files.
